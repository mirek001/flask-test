# Flask Test

This repository contains a minimal Flask application with a small note taking
example using SQLite. The home page still displays "Hello, World!" and a
"Notes" page lets you create notes with categories which are stored in a local
`notes.db` file. A new "Deliveries" page lets you track deliveries made to a
construction site. The "Delivery Calendar" page shows deliveries on a monthly
calendar.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Run the application with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser to see
the greeting. The notes page is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes](http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes) and the deliveries
page at
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/deliveries](http://127.0.0.1:5000/deliveries). The
calendar is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/calendar](http://127.0.0.1:5000/calendar).

### Ollama Integration

If you have an [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) server running locally on
`http://127.0.0.1:11434`, the notes page includes a **Generate with Ollama**
button. Enter a title and category and click the button to automatically fill
the content field with text generated by the model specified in `app.py`. The
default model is `mistral`.
